That’s it — ultralytics will handle YOLOv8 and all its internal dependencies. pandas is included just for training metrics.

If you're using a GPU, also check:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
(Adjust cu118 based on your CUDA version — or skip it for CPU-only.)

4. 🧪 Test your setup
yolo
You should see the Ultralytics CLI help output. If you don’t, something's wrong.

5. 🏃‍♂️ Run training
Now run your YOLO training script like:

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # or your custom .pt model
model.train(
    data="your_data.yaml",
    epochs=25,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=8,
    project="my_project",
    name="my_experiment"
)
Replace paths as needed.
